## Election-Audit Summary 

This analysis can be further used by the election commission for other elections as well. This code can be used to determine the winner, largest vote counts and percentages for any given election data set. This code can be used to extract more useful results and information with a few quick modifications depending on the nature of the information required. 

This elections analysis can be further used by the election commission to determine which counties voted for which candidate the most with a simple addition of an extra if-statement. Further contextual information available to the elections commission like political affiliations and platforms, can help make further conclusions about how certain counties vote and what the majority of the voters in those areas hold important. 

Moreover, changing the script to include larger states or a larger number of counties or candidates can help produce results for a bigger election dataset. This in addition to labels of political affiliations can help make larger conclusions about the voting populations and the turnout. This can be done by the addition of a column in the dataset relating to the voter’s choice of candidate the associated political affiliation. 

Contextualizing the provided analysis for more in-depth view of the dataset and the resulting conclusions will help you make better decisions about the voter populations, where to target more campaigning or resources and what the majority views are in certain geographical areas versus others.
